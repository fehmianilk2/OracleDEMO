# 🦅 Aesthesius Market Oracle DEMO

> **"Data is merely noise until logic gives it a voice."**

**Aesthesius Market Oracle** is an algorithmic financial intelligence tool developed to analyze stock market data in real-time. Unlike simple price trackers, this system applies technical analysis indicators (specifically **RSI**) to identify potential "Overbought" or "Oversold" conditions for major assets.
